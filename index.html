        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>The year is 2156. TIME Magazine has named “The Robot” person of the year. Every workplace, factory and retail
          setting is filled with robots working for society. The robots have been working day and night to finish
          production on the newest self-driving hoverboard. One particular Tuesday, the robots were working on
          finalizing the paint design for the newest F1473 Hoverboard Premium Ultimate Model when all of the sudden ….

        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <p>You've been called in for Detective work by the International Galactic Robot Department to solve the case.
          Ever since the world created a new population of Bots, there needed to be structure and order. You have been
          assigned to determine which Robot committed the crime based on witness clues provided. To win the game you
          must select the correct robo-attacker. Score is based on how many robots are left after you have selected the
          robo-attacker. The more innocent robots left, the higher your score will be.

          To begin the game, press the PLAY button. You will be directed to another webpage where the
          game will occur. During the game your mission is to select the robot who committed the crime. You will be
          shown one display of different robot pictures. When you hover over each robot with your mouse, it will provide
          a
          speech bubble text with randomized, specific information about them such as their name, physical description,
          etc. There
          are a variety of descriptors for each robot.

          Each round you have two options which are you are able to select another witness statement or guess the
          robo-attacker. If you select a
          witness statement, a witness statement text will populate at the top of the screen. The witness statement will
          give you more
          information on who the robo-attacker is in order to guess correctly.
          If you choose to guess the robo-attacker, then the game will tell you if you are correct or incorrect (the
          robot will be highlighted with a black border). If you are incorrect, an oil splash will fade over the robot's
          picture as well as the grim reaper will fade onto the screen to notify you.

          If you are correct, you have won
          the game. Congratulations!
