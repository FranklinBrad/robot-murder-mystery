## Game Description

* The robot murder mystery game is a guesswho/clue style game. The game player will start the game by pressing a play button on the main page. On the main page, the game also includes game rules, a github repo link and a scoreboard. We built this game after brainstorming unique ways to utilize an API in coding. 


## Game Rules
* You've been called in for Detective work by the International Galactic Robot Department to solve the case.  Ever since the world created a new population of Bots, there needed to be structure and order.  You have been assigned to determine which Robot committed the crime based on witness clues provided. To win the game you must select the correct Murderbot.
* Score is based on the number of innocent Robots who remain on screen after you have selected the Murderbot. The more innocent Robots left, the higher your score will be.
* * To begin the game, press the PLAY button. You will be directed to another webpage. 
* * On the new webpage, the game will ask you to enter your first name to store your highscore and for your Detective name!
* * During the game your mission is to select the robot who committed the crime. You will be shown a display of 20 different robot pictures.
* *  When you hover over EACH robot with your mouse, it will provide a speech bubble text with randomized, specific information about them such as their name, physical description, etc. There are a variety of descriptors for each robot.
* * Each round you have two options which are you are able to select another witness statement or guess the Murderbot.
* * If you select a witness statement, a witness statement text will populate at the top of the screen. The witness statement will give you more information on who the Murderbot is in order to guess correctly.
* * If you select a witness statement, a witness statement text will populate at the top of the screen. The witness statement will give you more information on who the Murderbot is in order to guess correctly.
* * If you choose to guess the Murderbot, then the game will tell you if you are correct or incorrect (the robot will be highlighted with a black border). If you are incorrect, an oil splash will fade over the robot's picture as well as the grim reaper will fade onto the screen to notify you.
* * If there are less than 15 robots left, hurry up! The Murderbot has a chance to target you which means game over for you. 
* * If you correctly select the Murderbot, you have won the game. A winning screen will show. Congratulations!
