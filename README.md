## game description

The robot murder mystery game is a guesswho/clue style game. The game player will start the game by pressing a play button on the main page. On the main page, the game also includes game rules, a github repo link and a scoreboard. 

The game begins by presenting a background story of the robots. There are random generated stories for each time the game plays. The user will enter a second HTML page where the game play will occur. There will be a display of robot images (based on the level of gameplan) where if hovered over will included random generated information. The information generated includes a hard code of physical descriptions of the robot images then joining to a mockroo generator of random identity descriptors. The player will go through a series of witness statements that will help the player narrow down the robot who committed the crime. The player will have an option to guess the crime robot or receive another clue. Each time the robot is guessed incorrectly, the screen will show an overlay of oil spilling over the character image. At the end of the game, the user will receive a score based on the how well they were able to detect the crime robot. The user will be able to play again after the game is over. 

Technical requirements of the game include:
- using Mockaroo to create an API for random generation
- ADD MORE HERE

This game creates a fun, interactive murder mystery game for the user.
